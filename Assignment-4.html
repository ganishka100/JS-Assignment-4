Q1. Create the Example for Logical Operators.

Ans1. Logical operators in JavaScript are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values. These
 operators are typically used in conditional statements and expressions to make decisions based on the 
 truthiness or falsiness of values.

Example:- 1. Using Logical AND (&&):
let isAdult = true;
let hasLicense = false;

if (isAdult && hasLicense) {
  console.log("You can drive!");
} else {
  console.log("You cannot drive.");
}

2. Using Logical OR (||):
let isWeekend = false;
let hasVacation = true;

if (isWeekend || hasVacation) {
  console.log("It's time to relax!");
} else {
  console.log("Back to work!");
}

3. Using Logical NOT (!):
let isLoggedIn = false;

if (!isLoggedIn) {
  console.log("Please log in to access the content.");
}

Q2. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.

Ans2. == (Equality Operator):
The == operator checks for equality after performing type coercion if necessary. This means that it 
converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison.

"5" == 5;      // true, because "5" is coerced to the number 5
null == undefined; // true, because null and undefined are considered equal

=== (Strict Equality Operator):
The === operator, on the other hand, checks for strict equality without performing type coercion. It 
compares both the values and the types of the operands. If the types are different, the result is false.

"5" === 5;     // false, because the types are different (string vs. number)
null === undefined; // false, because the types are different

Q3. How many operators do we have in JS ?

Ans3. JavaScript supports a variety of operators that can be categorized into several types.

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Unary Operators
7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
8. String Operators

Q4. What is use of parseInt in js?

Ans4. The parseInt function in JavaScript is used to parse a string and convert it into an integer. It
 takes two arguments: the string to be converted, and an optional argument called the radix, which 
 represents the numeral system to be used (base of the mathematical numeral system).

 Example:-
 let numericString = "123";
let integerValue = parseInt(numericString);

console.log(integerValue); // Output: 123

Q5. Take input from user and find the odd and even number.

Ans5. let num = prompt("Enter any number");
          num = Number.parseInt(num);
        
          if(num%2 == 0){
            console.log("Even Number");
          }
          else{
            console.log("Odd Number");
          }
